# WINE_QUALITY_PREDICTION

 The Wine Quality Prediction project aims to determine the quality of wines based on specific attributes using linear regression. By training a machine learning model on a dataset comprising various wine characteristics, the model can predict the quality rating of a given wine sample. The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:<br>
 1.Fixed acidity <br>
 2.Volatile acidity <br>
 3.Citric acid <br>
 4.Residual sugar <br>
 5.Chlorides <br>
 6.Free sulfur dioxide <br>
 7.Total sulfur dioxide <br>
 8.Density <br>
 9.pH <br>
10.Sulfates <br>
11.Alcohol <br>
Based on the above features the quality of wine is predicted using linear regresion model.
